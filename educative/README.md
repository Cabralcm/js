# React and JS

## Innovation

React can be integrated seamlessly with other libraries or frameworks because React is a VIEW ONLY library.

It is the VIEW part of Model View Controller [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) architectural UI pattern.

The freedom to use any other framework and library makes it possible to experiment and so to innovate.

# Simple API

React, simple API, has no steep learning curve. Only handful of methods to understand. Code to make components of the UI (e.g. buttons), is straight-forward as there is very little boilerplate code, which makes the library accessable.

# JavaScript

Both a Functional and Object-Oriented programming language. React is in JS.

# ES6

[ES6](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/es6-javascript-programmers-need-know/) refers to Version 6 of the ECMA Script Programming language. 
EMCA script is the standardized name for JavaScript, version 6 was released in 2015. Major JS enhancement. Adds many more features to make large-scale software development easier.

# JSX

JSX --> JavaScript Syntax Extension. Allows you to use HTML and XML is JavaScript. Essentially the HTML/XML code is 'transpiled' into JavaScript. That is, the HTML/XML is converted into JavaScript before the code is complied. 
Enables the full power of JS to be employed with the releative ease of writing in HTML.

# Unidirectional Data Flow

React --> One-way data flow. Makes it easy to reason about your app.
All parts of the UI are contained within each other, makes tracing data flow simple.
